# Introduction
This application displays information on three different types of drink. The three drinks are beer, juice, and soda that inherit from a common, base class called Drink. The base properties indicate the drink name, whether it is carbonated, and a description of the drink. 

The subclass juice has a string property indicating the fruit from which it is made; the subclass beer has a property indicating its alcohol content. The descriptions are overriden in each drink subclass. For example, the soda includes the soda name and whether it is carbonated. The juice includes the name of the fruit, and the beer includes the alcohol content.

The CreateEvent.java class adds three drink instances to an array list: one is orange juice (that is not carbonated and is made from oranges); one is Budweiser of type beer (that is carbonated with 5% alcohol content); and one is Pepsi of type soda (that is carbonated). When the program is run, the statement is given to describe the drink; for example, “Orange Juice, not carbonated, made from oranges. Budweiser, carbonated, 5%. Pepsi, carbonated.”
